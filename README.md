# self_checkout_fraud_classification

This repository contains R scripts designed for detecting fraudulent transactions at retail self-checkout systems. It was developed as part of the DATA MINING CUP 2019 challenge, with the task detail could be found in file DATA-MINING-CUP-2019-task.pdf.

## Script Features
1. Data Preprocessing: Prepares data by cleaning and transforming it as necessary. Details on the data features can be found in the file DATA-MINING-CUP-2019-features.pdf.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis: Provides basic statistical outputs and visualizations to facilitate understanding of the data's structure.
3. Feature Engineering: Applies feature selection techniques to refine the model's input variables.
4. Model Building and Evaluation: Trains and evaluates several machine learning models.
5. Model Stacking: Enhances prediction accuracy by combining multiple models through stacking techniques.
6. Prediction and Evaluation: Predicts fraudulent transactions on the test dataset and evaluates the model's performance using a custom monetary payoff function.
